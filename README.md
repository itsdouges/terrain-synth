# Terrain Synth

Example-based Terrain Generation powered by real-earth datasets.

This is a platform for me to hack around on various machine-learning content generation techniques.

The current model is very na√Øve, expect the output to look crap.

### Example Input

Terrain elevation data downsampled

### Example Output

(Silly) generated terrain

## Technologies

- pytorch for ML learning
- onnex runtime (https://onnxruntime.ai/) for model inference
- react / typescript / vite for the app
- react-three/fiber / threejs for 3D rendering
- pulumi / aws for deployment
